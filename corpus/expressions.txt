addition is left associative

def a = x - y - z

===
multiplication has higher precedence that addition

===
parens work

===
function applys work as expected

function applys have higher precedence than multiplication

===
apply and neg don't break subtraction
===

def a = x -y

===
neg binds after apply
===

def a = - x y

===
neg binds before mul
===

def a = -x * y

===
if works
===

def x = if a then b else c + d
